# Pre-work - Tippakuma

Tippakuma is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Maireen Espiritu

Time spent: 10 hours in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Allows user to enter a custom amount that they want to contribute for tip
- [x] Splits the bill (including tip among up to 4 people)

## Notes

Some challenges I faced while creating this app was being able to change the default setting in the settings page. I did previously have a settings page designed, however I decided to remove it because it was difficult for me to implement one. There were serveral errors that I encountered when I thought I had reached a solution, and I figured that it would just be better for the sake of time to take it out.
